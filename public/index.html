      content="As a highly skilled blockchain developer, I am well-versed in the latest technologies and trends in the field. I have a deep understanding of the architecture and mechanics of blockchain systems, as well as experience building and deploying decentralized applications. My strong coding skills in languages such as Solidity, Python, and javascript make me an asset to any team looking to leverage the power of blockchain technology.

      I have experience building dApps and smart contracts on Ethereum and Hyperledger platforms.
      
      In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong collaborator and communicator, with the ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am always eager to take on new challenges and continue learning in this fast-paced and rapidly evolving field."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
